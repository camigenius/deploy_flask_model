# deploy_flask_model
In this application a machine learning model is deployed through Flask. First the model is trained and then through the "pickle" package (you can also use the "joblib" package) it is saved.

Then the HTML template is created from which the value of the features is entered and finally with the POST method the predictions are obtained.
